# Optimization-of-Medical-Inventory
## Overview
The Optimization of Medical Inventory project aims to create a robust system for managing and optimizing the inventory of medical supplies in healthcare facilities. Efficient inventory management is crucial to ensure the availability of necessary medical supplies, reduce waste, and minimize costs. This project leverages data science techniques, including predictive analytics with the SARIMAX model, and provides an interactive interface using Streamlit.

## Objectives
- **Predict Demand:** Forecast the demand for medical supplies using the SARIMAX model to maintain optimal inventory levels.
- **Minimize Costs:** Develop strategies to minimize costs related to storage, order processing, and waste due to expiration.
- **Enhance Efficiency:** Improve the efficiency of inventory management processes, reducing the time spent on manual inventory checks.
- **Ensure Availability:** Guarantee the availability of critical medical supplies to avoid stockouts, especially during emergencies.

## Features
- **Demand Forecasting:** Uses the SARIMAX model to predict future demand for various medical supplies based on historical data.
- **Inventory Optimization:** Implements optimization algorithms to maintain optimal inventory levels, balancing costs and availability.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides an interactive interface built with Streamlit for visualizing data, running models, and generating reports.
- **Automatic Reordering:** Generates reorder alerts or automatically places orders when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Tracks and optimizes the supply chain to ensure timely delivery of medical supplies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data analysis, machine learning, and optimization algorithms.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Statsmodels:** For implementing the SARIMAX model.
- **Scikit-learn & TensorFlow:** For additional predictive modeling (if applicable).
- **PuLP or SciPy:** For implementing optimization algorithms.
- **SQL:** For managing inventory data.
- **Streamlit:** For developing the interactive dashboard.
- **Power BI or Tableau:** For advanced data visualization and reporting.
